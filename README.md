# CHART
<strong>[2015/04/10]</strong><br/>
I tested two charts libraries - NVD3 and Highcharts.<br/>
NVD3 is a good library if you don't change the setting, e.g.,there's no option to disable default control options. ( The solution is remove the control after the graph has been drawn) <br/>
And it's not easy to customized some style.(Add border to a area chart) <br/>
Highchart might be better for this project.<br/>
Small example of area chart.
